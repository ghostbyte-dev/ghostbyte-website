Every journey starts with a first step - and every blog starts with a **Hello World**.  

This is the very first post on the Ghostbyte blog. Nothing fancy, just a marker in time that says: *weâ€™ve begun*.  

Stay tuned - the next post will introduce who we are, what Ghostbyte is about, and what you can expect from this blog.
