We are Daniel and Emanuel, two brothers  with a shared passion for creating great software. We are both from Vorarlberg, Austria and are currently studying Informatics at TU Wien in Vienna. We are always working on some cool projects. Most of them are open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/ghostbyte-dev).

Earlier this year we decided that it would be cool to maintain our best projects together under a company name. An this company name is Ghostbyte.

## What is Ghostbyte
Ghostbyte is more than just a studio name. For us, it’s about building products that feel great, exploring exciting new technologies and maintaining open source software. In addition to our projects we want to develop websites for local businesses to make the web a more beautiful place.

## Our Projects
So far our portfolio consists of the following projects:
+ **Pixelix**: Mobile client for the photo sharing network Pixelfed.
+ **Together**: Online platform to manage households.
+ **Github Release Stats**: Web-app for seeing download numbers of Github releases.
+ **Ghostbyte Library**: Collection of useful web resources especially for designers and developers.
+ **Veritate Website**: Website for the Viennese Metal band Veritate.
+ **Daily Tasks**: Android implementation of the Ivy Lee Method.
+ **Socialfolio**: Platform for presenting all your social media accounts in one place.

And of course the journey isn't over here, we are already working hard on the next projects.

## What's this Blog about?
This blog should be the place for us to tell the stories we want to tell.
To be honest we both never wrote some kind of blog ever before, so this one is very experimental. Please don't expect the posts to be perfect, because then you probably will be disappointed :(

Here we want to:
+ Give insights into our projects.
+ Explain interesting problems and solutions we stumbled about in our journey.
+ Share knowledge we acquired over the years.
+ Write about everything that's on our minds.

We want it to be useful for other developers and everyone who is interested. Our goal is too keep it inspiring, transparent and personal.

Thanks for stopping by and joining us on this journey :)
